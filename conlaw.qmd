## Week 1.2 -- Introduction

### I. "No Vehicles in the Park" & the Logic of Legal Interpretation

This famous hypothetical (often used by H.L.A. Hart and in constitutional seminars) highlights **five interpretive problems**:

| Problem                             | Constitutional Doctrine Implicated                               | Redish-style Analysis                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Vagueness**                    | Due Process (5A/14A) – _Void for Vagueness_                      | No fair notice; fails procedural due process                        |
| **2. No enforcement mechanism**     | Non-justiciability (no case or controversy); Delegation Doctrine | Unenforceable law = no standing = no case to interpret              |
| **3. No enforcement body assigned** | Separation of powers problem? Possibly a delegation issue        | Might suggest unconstitutional vagueness or improper delegation     |
| **4. Ambiguity across time**        | _Originalism vs. Living Constitutionalism_                       | Was “vehicle” intended to include drones? Strollers? Wheelchairs?   |
| **5. Lack of purpose statement**    | Legislative intent; purposivism vs textualism                    | What was the statute meant to do? Public safety or noise reduction? |
### II. Can SCOTUS Strike Down a Law for Vagueness _Alone_?

✅ **Yes.** Even if a law doesn’t violate a specific enumerated right (like speech or religion), it can be struck down for being **so vague** that it **violates due process** by:
- Failing to give **fair notice**
- Enabling **arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement**

Doctrine: **Void for Vagueness**
- Rooted in **Procedural Due Process:**
    - **5A** (federal laws)
    - **14A** (state laws)

Key Precedents:

| Case                                              | Holding                             | Justice Notes                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville_ (1972)** | Struck down vague vagrancy law      | **Douglas** (majority): Vagueness enables police abuse                             |
| **_Kolender v. Lawson_ (1983)**                   | Struck down ID law with vague terms | **O’Connor** (majority); **Brennan** concurrence: focused on arbitrary enforcement |
| **_FCC v. Fox_ (2012)**                           | Indecency policy was vague          | **Kennedy**: Due Process requires fair notice even in admin law                    |
| **_Sessions v. Dimaya_ (2018)**                   | Vague deportation statute struck    | **Gorsuch** sided with liberal wing; emphasized nondelegation + liberty            |
In *Dimaya*:
- **Gorsuch (concur)**:
    - Reinforced **nondelegation** principles and **rule of law**.
    - Warned against the **"ghastly power of the criminal law”** in vague statutes.
- **Thomas (dissent)**:
    - Argued the Court improperly applied vagueness to **civil removal** proceedings.
    - Criticized erosion of **legislative discretion**.

### III. Can a Justice _Unilaterally_ Strike a Law or Trigger Review?

❌ No — **SCOTUS is fundamentally reactive.**
- **Cannot sua sponte** strike down a law without:
    - A **case or controversy** (Article III)
    - A **properly filed case** reaching the Court via certiorari or appeal

However, justices have tools to **encourage** challenges:

| Method                                    | Details                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Public Remarks / Dissents from Denial** | Justices (e.g., **Sotomayor**) can issue **dissents from denial of certiorari** to draw attention to unjust laws        |
| **Emergency Docket**                      | If a case is filed (e.g., by ACLU or NIJC), a justice can vote to place it on the **emergency "shadow docket"**         |
| **Amicus Signal**                         | Justices may **signal** in prior opinions that a law is ripe for challenge                                              |
| **Law Clerk/Advocacy Backchannel**        | Though ethically delicate, justices can privately express **skepticism** of a law’s constitutionality, prompting action |

### IV. What if Someone Sues a Supreme Court Justice?

**Technically possible, practically impossible.**
- **Absolute Immunity**: Justices are immune from suit for **official actions**, per _Stump v. Sparkman_, 435 U.S. 349 (1978).
- A case **cannot proceed** to SCOTUS where a justice is a **defendant**, since it would present:
    - **Recusal issues**
    - **Violation of separation of powers**
    - **Lack of neutral adjudicator**
- So no, you can’t sue Sotomayor and expect the Court to rule on itself.

> Courts do consider: "COULD the government do this?" 
> They do NOT consider: "SHOULD the government do this?"

### V. How to Read a Case Redish-Style

| Step                          | Description                                                        | Mental Goal                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. **First Read**             | Identify **facts vs issues**                                       | Orient yourself: what is the fight about?                       |
| 2. **Second Pass**            | Divide into **holding, logic, context**                            | What rule of law was applied and how?                           |
| 3. **Justice-specific views** | Identify **majority, concurrence, dissent**                        | Who said what, and why does it matter?                          |
| 4. **Analogies + Evolution**  | How did the Court reason by analogy? How did this case evolve law? | Legal thought is cumulative; identify shifts                    |
| 5. **Outcome Relevance**      | What changes in the law? Who wins? Why should I care?              | Connect to broader themes (due process, equal protection, etc.) |

## Week 2.1 -- The State Action Doctrine

### I. Constitutional Tests and State Action

| **Test**                  | **Standard of Review**                                                                             | **Used When**                                                                    | **Burden of Proof**                             |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Strict Scrutiny**       | Law must be *narrowly tailored* to serve a *compelling* government interest.                       | Applied to **racial classifications** or infringement on **fundamental rights**. | **Government** must justify the classification. |
| **Intermediate Scrutiny** | Law must further an important government interest in a way substantially related to that interest. | Gender and some quasi-suspect classifications.                                   | Government must justify the classification.     |
| **Rational Basis**        | Law must be rationally related to a legitimate government interest.                                | All other cases not involving suspect classifications or fundamental rights.     | **Challenger** must prove irrationality.        |

In practice, a private party’s conduct becomes “state action” if any one of these is true:
1. **Legislative or regulatory**: A government statute or regulation directly compels or authorizes the conduct.
2. **Official actor**: A government official, acting under color of law, participates in or enforces the conduct.
3. **Public function / entanglement**: The private party is (a) performing a function traditionally and exclusively done by the government, or (b) so entwined with the government (leases, licensing, subsidy, symbiosis) that its actions are fairly attributable to the State.
The cases below sit along a **spectrum of entanglement**—from absolute state action (courts enforcing covenants) to clear non‑action (mere licensing).
- State action doctrine is a "conceptual disaster area" and theories about it are a "torch-less search for a way out of a damp echoing cave."
- Any state enforcement or delegation of discriminatory practices violates the Constitution—regardless of whether the discrimination originated with the state or a private party.

### 1. **Shelley v. Kraemer**, 334 U.S. 1 (1948)

> **Facts?**  
>  – Private homeowners’ association in St. Louis had racially restrictive covenants forbidding sale to “any person not of the Caucasian race.”  
>  – The Shelleys (Black) bought a house; neighbors (Kraemers) sued in state court to enforce the covenant.

> **Shelley’s argument?**  
>  – Judicial enforcement of the covenant is “state action” under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.

> **Kraemer’s argument?**  
>  – Covenants are purely private agreements; enforcement by state courts is ministerial, not “action” under the Fourteenth Amendment.

> **Holding?**  
>  – **Yes**: When a court enforces a racially discriminatory covenant, that enforcement is state action—and it violates Equal Protection.

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
>  – _Ex parte Virginia_, 100 U.S. 339 (1880), on enforcing discrimination as state action;  
>  – _The Civil Rights Cases_, 109 U.S. 3 (1883), crafting the state‑action principle;  
>  – Early Equal Protection decisions on judicial enforcement.

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
>  – Fourteenth Amendment, § 1 (“No State shall… deny to any person… equal protection of the laws.”)

> **Concurrences:**
> 
> - **Justice Murphy:** Racial covenants are “inherently repugnant to the free society” and violate due process as well as equal protection.
> - **Justice Jackson:** Emphasized that a judicial decree—even to effect a private contract—transforms that contract into state action.
> - **Justice Burton:** Focused on the enforcement machinery itself: “the state cannot be a party to a private wrong.”

> **Dissents:**  
> – _None._ (Unanimous in outcome; three separate concurrences.)

### 2. Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715 (1961)

> **Facts?**  
>  – A municipally owned parking authority leased ground‑floor space to the Eagle Coffee Shop, which refused service to James Irvis, an African‑American.

> **Irvis’s argument?**  
>  – The close financial and structural “symbiosis” between the Parking Authority and the restaurant makes the restaurant’s conduct state action under Equal Protection.

> **Authority’s/Restaurant’s argument?**  
>  – The restaurant is privately owned; discrimination in its seating policy is private, not attributable to the State.

> **Holding?**  
>  – **Yes**: Because the Authority granted exclusive lease, provided utilities, and shared profits, the restaurant’s discriminatory policy is fairly attributable to the State.

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
>  – _Marsh v. Alabama_ (326 U.S. 501 (1946))—private company town held state action;  
>  – _Shelley v. Kraemer_—judicial enforcement as state action.

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
>  – Fourteenth Amendment, § 1 (“No State shall… deny… equal protection.”)

> **Concurrences:**
> - **Justice Brennan:** Highlighted the Authority’s tax exemptions and liability protection as further entangling the public and private actors.

> **Dissents:**  
> – _None._ (Unanimous decision; one concurrence.)

### 3. Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163 (1972)

> **Facts?**  
>  – Moose Lodge, a private fraternal organization in Pennsylvania, excluded Black members. Plaintiff Irvis was denied a drink. The State requires all liquor‑license applicants—public or private—to obtain a state permit.

> **Irvis’s argument?**  
>  – That state licensing of all establishments, including Moose Lodge, creates sufficient state action to invoke Equal Protection.

> **Moose Lodge’s argument?**  
>  – Licensing is a neutral, general regulation; membership and service policies remain purely private choices.

> **Holding?**  
>  – **No**: A mere state license, without more direct regulation or support, does not make private discrimination “state action.”

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
>  – _Burton v. Wilmington_—symbiotic entanglement test;  
>  – _Marsh v. Alabama_—public function test;  
>  – _Shelley v. Kraemer_—enforcement as action.

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
>  – Fourteenth Amendment, § 1.

> **Concurrences:**
> - **Justice Stewart:** Argued that licensing is too attenuated—“a mere state permit” doesn’t transform private choice into official conduct.

> **Dissents:**
> - **Justice Brennan (joined by Justice Marshall & Justice Douglas):** Maintained that the state’s power to revoke the license and the regulatory benefits conferred create enough entanglement to treat Moose Lodge’s discrimination as state action.

### II. State Action Doctrine: Four Main Tests

| **Test Name**                          | **Rule / Legal Standard**                                                                                                          | **Key Cases**                                                                                                                                | **Limitations**                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Public Function Test**            | A private party is a state actor **only if** performing a function **traditionally and exclusively** done by the state.            | 🔹 _Marsh v. Alabama_ (1946) — Company town with public sidewalks  <br>🔹 E.g., elections, prisons                                           | 🛑 **Fails** if the function is not _exclusively_ public.  <br>Education, hospitals, even policing ≠ always enough. |
| **2. Entanglement / Symbiotic Test**   | State action exists where the government is **significantly involved**, **encourages**, or **benefits** from private conduct.      | 🔹 _Burton v. Wilmington PA_ (1961) — State-owned garage leasing to racist coffee shop  <br>🔹 _Moose Lodge_ (1972) — License ≠ entanglement | 🛑 **Mere regulation, licensing, or funding ≠ sufficient**. Must be **mutual, operational integration.**            |
| **3. State Compulsion Test**           | State action occurs when the government **coerces, mandates, or enforces** the private conduct.                                    | 🔹 _Shelley v. Kraemer_ (1948) — Court enforcement of racist covenant = state action  <br>🔹 Utility termination orders                      | 🛑 No state action if the private decision was made **independently**, without coercion or mandate.                 |
| **4. Nexus / Close Relationship Test** | If there’s a **close connection** such that the private action is **fairly attributable to the state**, it counts as state action. | 🔹 _Lugar v. Edmondson Oil_ (1982) — State-aided seizure of property by creditor                                                             | 🛑 Vague test; courts rarely apply it without concrete state involvement (e.g., use of courts or police power).     |

### III. Additional Notes

Analogy -- First Amendment Freedom of Association:
- **Private parade/assembly:** If organized entirely by private individuals (no state sponsorship, no permit conditions), the organizer may exclude on any basis (race, gender, ideology) without running afoul of the First or Fourteenth Amendments.
- **State involvement test:** If the parade uses public streets under a state‑issued permit that conditions non‑discrimination, or if the organizer receives special government funding, then exclusion may be state action and trigger strict scrutiny (e.g., _NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware_ analogies).

- _Burton_ stands for the principle that **public-private partnerships come with constitutional baggage**. If a government agency creates an appearance of unity with a private actor—physically (shared doors), financially (shared rent/utilities), or operationally (shared public services)—then the **private actor inherits the state's constitutional obligations.**
- The Court **doesn’t require ==actual knowledge or direct control**==—just that the **state put itself in a position where discrimination could flourish on public grounds.** The closer the physical and economic entanglement, the heavier the constitutional burden.
- Four people in my house:
	- Common-sense skepticism: if I rent out part of my house, am I suddenly responsible for guests’ actions?
	- The answer is: **only if you're the state**.

- Distinction between *Burton* and *Moose Lodge*:
	- In _Moose Lodge_, the Court **narrows the concept of entanglement**. Merely having a **state liquor license** is not enough to make a private club’s actions **state action** under the Fourteenth Amendment.
	- The distinction hinges on **mutual benefit and integration**:
		- In _Burton_, the state and the lessee were **symbiotically linked**—sharing profits, facilities, and utilities.
		- In _Moose Lodge_, the state’s involvement was **general and regulatory**, not **specific or supportive** of the discriminatory practice.

> Always map: (1) **Who** is acting? (2) **Under what authority or support?** (3) **What constitutional guarantee is at stake?

Using IRAC when analyzing a state action question:
- **Issue**: Is the private party’s conduct subject to constitutional limits?
- **Rule**: Apply all four tests.
- **Application**: Go through each one based on the facts.
- **Conclusion**: State action **only if** one of these tests is met.

## Week 2.2 -- The Due Process Clause and Fundamental Rights

### I. The Countermajoritarian Judiciary

| **Question**                                            | **Underlying Tension**                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| When should courts override legislative action?         | When a **constitutional limitation**—especially one involving **fundamental rights or suspect classifications**—is at stake.                         |
| When should courts defer?                               | When the issue falls into **political questions**, **economic regulation**, or **rational basis review**—i.e., **majoritarian domain**.              |
| Why allow unelected judges to overrule democratic will? | To **protect minorities**, **prevent tyranny of the majority**, and **enforce constitutional structure and rights** that aren't subject to vote.     |
| What is the difference between law and doctrine?        | **Law** is enacted by legislatures and binding through statutes. **Doctrine** is judge-made—rules created to interpret the Constitution or statutes. |

**When Does the Court “Create” New Rules?**

| Action by the Court           | Example Cases                               | Type of Judicial Behavior                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Invents or expands rights     | _Griswold_, _Roe_, _Lawrence_, _Obergefell_ | **Judicial Activism** (criticized by originalists) |
| Clarifies existing doctrines  | _Glucksberg_, _Casey_                       | **Judicial Restraint** or minimalism               |
| Creates enforcement doctrines | _Miranda_, _Gideon_, _Shelley_              | **Doctrinal necessity** (process creation)         |

**Judicial Doctrine vs. Legislative Law**
- Legislative law is **explicit, prospective**, and subject to democratic checks.
- Judicial doctrine is **interpretive, precedential**, and can look like "law about law."
- It can be **passive** (just choosing a framework like tiers of scrutiny), or **activist** (declaring new rights or rules).
- The legitimacy of doctrine depends on whether courts are **interpreting**, **applying**, or **inventing** principles.

> 🧠 **The real balance question** is:  
> “When does doctrine preserve the Constitution, and when does it usurp democracy?”

### II. Due Process & Fundamental Rights

The **Due Process Clause** (5th and 14th Amendments) guarantees more than procedural fairness—it also protects certain **substantive liberties** from government interference, even with “due process.” 

> 💬 "Liberty" = **Certain interests so central to autonomy and dignity** that **government can’t infringe** them without extraordinary justification.
> 🛑 But: Rights are **not absolute**. A "fundamental" right **triggers scrutiny**, not immunity. Rights are always context and extent dependent.

- When courts recognize a new right, they **remove it from democratic politics**—they’re saying, _“You can no longer vote to restrict this.”_
- That’s why **due process rights are mostly negative**: they **block** the government from doing things, rather than requiring it to **affirmatively** provide things (e.g., housing, health care).

**Substantive Due Process Doctrine**
- Refer to the earlier table detailing three levels of scrutiny

Key Case: _Washington v. Glucksberg_ (1997)
- **Facts:** Washington state banned physician-assisted suicide. Plaintiffs claimed the ban violated a constitutional **liberty interest** in controlling one’s death.
- **Issue:** Does the Due Process Clause protect the right to physician-assisted suicide?
- **Holding (Chief Justice Rehnquist, Majority):** **No.** The right to assisted suicide is **not a fundamental liberty interest** protected by the Constitution.
- **Reasoning:**
    1. **Two-step test for new fundamental rights**:
        - (1) Is the right **deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and tradition**?
        - (2) Is it **implicit in the concept of ordered liberty**?
    2. The Court emphasized **judicial restraint**:
        - Warned against expanding substantive due process without historical foundation.
        - Framed itself as deferring to democratic debate and **state experimentation**.

>  “The mere novelty of such a claim is reason enough to doubt that 'liberty' encompasses it.”

- **Concurring Opinions:**

| Justice                   | View                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **O’Connor (concurring)** | Emphasized importance of **palliative care** and **autonomy**, but stopped short of declaring a constitutional right to die. |
| **Stevens (concurring)**  | Suggested that **under certain facts**, such a right might exist, but voted with the majority.                               |
| **Souter (concurring)**   | Warned about **judicial minimalism becoming too rigid**, but agreed with historical approach.                                |

**Partial List of Recognized Fundamental Rights (Substantive Due Process):**

| **Category**           | **Examples**                                                                                                       | **Key Cases**                                     |

Erwin Cheminsky -- Against Judicial Activism:
- Substantive due process is one of the most controversial and contested right in the entire American legal system.
- Substantive due process is **not textually grounded**—it interprets “liberty” expansively.
- Critics: It's a “judicial invention,” inviting **activism**.
- Supporters: It's essential to **protect unenumerated but fundamental rights** from **majoritarian overreach**.

### 1. Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45 (1905)

> **Facts?**  
> – A New York law limited bakers to working no more than 60 hours per week or 10 hours per day. A bakery owner was fined for violating it.

> **Lochner’s argument?**  
> – The law violated his and his workers’ **liberty of contract**, protected by the **Due Process Clause** of the Fourteenth Amendment.

> **New York’s argument?**  
> – The law served the public interest by protecting the health and safety of bakers, a legitimate exercise of the state's **police powers**.

> **Holding?**  
> – **Yes**: The Court struck down the law, holding that it **unreasonably interfered** with freedom of contract.

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
> – Earlier substantive due process and economic liberty cases, though the Court heavily relied on its own balancing of liberty vs. police power.

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
> – Fourteenth Amendment, **Due Process Clause** (substantive interpretation).

> **Liberty interest?**  
> – Right to enter into employment contracts without excessive state interference.

> **State action?**  
> – New York labor statute limiting work hours.

> **Level of scrutiny?**  
> – Not formally articulated, but effectively **strict scrutiny** for economic liberty.

> **Significance?**  
> – A hallmark of the **Lochner era**, where the Court used **substantive due process** to strike down economic regulations. Later heavily criticized as judicial overreach and overturned in spirit by _West Coast Hotel_.

### 2. Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923)

> **Facts?**  
> – Nebraska law prohibited teaching modern foreign languages (like German) to students before 8th grade. Meyer, a teacher, taught German to a student and was convicted.

> **Meyer’s argument?**  
> – The law violated his and the parent’s **liberty** under the Fourteenth Amendment, including the rights to **teach, learn, and direct a child’s education**.

> **Nebraska’s argument?**  
> – The law served the public welfare by promoting civic unity and English literacy in post-WWI America.

> **Holding?**  
> – **Yes**: The Court struck down the law as **an arbitrary interference with individual liberty**.

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
> – Early substantive due process decisions and common-law traditions of parental rights and personal liberty.

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
> – Fourteenth Amendment, **Due Process Clause**.

> **Liberty interest?**  
> – Rights of parents to control their children’s education; right of individuals to teach and learn.

> **State action?**  
> – State statute restricting curriculum content in private schools.

> **Level of scrutiny?**  
> – Not formally tiered, but applied a **heightened (quasi-strict) scrutiny** based on liberty interference.

> **Significance?**  
> – Expanded **substantive due process beyond economics** to include **cultural and educational autonomy**. Helped lay groundwork for later privacy and parental rights cases.

### 3. Williamson v. Lee Optical, 348 U.S. 483 (1955)

> **Facts?**  
> – Oklahoma law made it illegal for opticians to fit lenses without a prescription from an ophthalmologist or optometrist. A business challenged the law as irrational.

> **Williamson’s argument?**  
> – The law was **economically protectionist** and served no rational purpose, thus violating the **Due Process Clause**.

> **State’s argument?**  
> – The law could promote public eye health, even if indirectly, and the legislature has wide discretion to regulate professions.

> **Holding?**  
> – **No**: The Court upheld the law, even if it was “needless” or “wasteful,” because it met the **rational basis** test.

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
> – Post-Lochner cases like _Nebbia v. New York_ (1934) and _West Coast Hotel_ that upheld economic regulations.

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
> – Fourteenth Amendment, **Due Process Clause**.

> **Liberty interest?**  
> – Economic liberty: the right to operate a business without arbitrary regulation.

> **State action?**  
> – State regulation governing optician practices.

> **Level of scrutiny?**  
> – **Rational basis**—law presumed valid if any conceivable purpose exists.

> **Significance?**  
> – Cemented **judicial deference to economic regulation**, marking a full rejection of **Lochner-era activism**. The law does not have to be wise—just **not irrational**.

### 4. Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U.S. 500 (1964)

> **Facts?**  
> – Under the Subversive Activities Control Act, the Secretary of State denied passports to members of the Communist Party. Aptheker, a U.S. citizen and party official, was barred from foreign travel.

> **Aptheker’s argument?**  
> – The passport denial violated his **liberty to travel internationally** under the **Due Process Clause**, and it was an overbroad infringement based on **guilt by association**.

> **Government’s argument?**  
> – National security justified restricting travel by individuals associated with subversive organizations.

> **Holding?**  
> – **Yes**: The statute was **facially unconstitutional** because it **swept too broadly**, applying to all party members regardless of their individual conduct.

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
> – _Kent v. Dulles_ (1958) on the right to travel; First and Fifth Amendment associational and liberty protections.

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
> – Fifth Amendment **Due Process Clause**, with implications from the First Amendment’s freedom of association.

> **Liberty interest?**  
> – Right to **international travel** and freedom of political association.

> **State action?**  
> – Federal statute enforced by executive agency (State Department).

> **Level of scrutiny?**  
> – Effectively **heightened scrutiny**—not labeled “strict,” but Court looked for tailoring to compelling interest.

> **Significance?**  
> – Reaffirmed that **liberty interests can’t be infringed by overly broad laws**, especially where **associational rights** are implicated. Imposed limits on executive power in national security contexts.

### 5. (Bonus) West Coast Hotel v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379 (1937)

> **Facts?**  
> – A Washington state minimum wage law for women was challenged by a hotel owner who claimed it violated freedom of contract.

> **Parrish’s argument?**  
> – The law served the public interest and addressed harmful labor practices; economic liberty was not absolute.

> **Hotel’s argument?**  
> – The law infringed on the employer’s and employee’s **freedom of contract**, violating due process.

> **Holding?**  
> – **No**: The Court upheld the law, explicitly rejecting the **Lochner** approach.

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
> – Overruled Lochner implicitly; relied on **Nebbia v. New York** (1934).

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
> – Fourteenth Amendment **Due Process Clause**.

> **Liberty interest?**  
> – Economic liberty: right to negotiate wages.

> **State action?**  
> – State labor law mandating minimum wages.

> **Level of scrutiny?**  
> – **Rational basis**—deferential review of economic legislation.

> **Significance?**  
> – Marked the **end of the Lochner era**, launching the **modern doctrine of deference to legislatures** in economic regulation.

### IV. Additional Analogy on Free Speech (From CRS)
#### Freedom of speech includes the right:

- Not to speak (specifically, the right not to salute the flag).  
    _West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette_, 319 U.S. 624 (1943).
- Of students to wear black armbands to school to protest a war (“Students do not shed their constitutional rights at the schoolhouse gate.”).  
    _Tinker v. Des Moines_, 393 U.S. 503 (1969).
- To use certain offensive words and phrases to convey political messages.  
    _Cohen v. California_, 403 U.S. 15 (1971).
- To contribute money (under certain circumstances) to political campaigns.  
    _Buckley v. Valeo_, 424 U.S. 1 (1976).
- To advertise commercial products and professional services (with some restrictions).  
    _Virginia Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Consumer Council_, 425 U.S. 748 (1976); _Bates v. State Bar of Arizona_, 433 U.S. 350 (1977).
- To engage in symbolic speech, (e.g., burning the flag in protest).  
    _Texas v. Johnson_, 491 U.S. 397 (1989); _United States v. Eichman_, 496 U.S. 310 (1990).

#### Freedom of speech does not include the right:

- To incite imminent lawless action.  
    _Brandenburg v. Ohio_, 395 U.S. 444 (1969).
- To make or distribute obscene materials.  
    _Roth v. United States_, 354 U.S. 476 (1957).
- To burn draft cards as an anti-war protest.  
    _United States v. O’Brien_, 391 U.S. 367 (1968).
- To permit students to print articles in a school newspaper over the objections of the school administration.   
    _Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier_, 484 U.S. 260 (1988).
- Of students to make an obscene speech at a school-sponsored event.  
    _Bethel School District #43 v. Fraser_, 478 U.S. 675 (1986).
- Of students to advocate illegal drug use at a school-sponsored event.  
    _Morse v. Frederick, __ U.S. ___ (2007).

***
## Week 3.1 -- Bodily Autonomy

Fundamental Right to Privacy → Contraception and Bodily Autonomy

> The Constitution protects **zones of personal autonomy**—particularly concerning **marriage, sex, procreation, family, and bodily integrity**—under a doctrine of **substantive due process**.

### 1. Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965)

> **Facts?**  
> – Connecticut criminalized the use of contraceptives, even by married couples. Estelle Griswold, Director of Planned Parenthood, was convicted for providing them.

> **Griswold’s argument?**  
> – The law violated the **right to privacy** in marital relations. Cited _Skinner v. Oklahoma_ (1942): **marriage and procreation** are fundamental to liberty.

> **Connecticut’s argument?**  
> – The statute protected **public morality**, discouraging **premarital sex** and preserving social norms.

> **Holding?**  
> – **Yes**: The law was unconstitutional. The Court held that **marital privacy is a protected liberty**, found in the **“penumbras” of specific Bill of Rights guarantees**.

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
> – _Skinner_, _Meyer_, _Pierce_, and selective incorporation doctrine.

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
> – Majority (Douglas): Privacy comes from **1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 9th Amendments**. Not due process.

> **Liberty interest?**  
> – Right of **marital privacy** in intimate decisions about contraception.

> **State action?**  
> – Connecticut’s criminal statute punishing use and counseling of contraceptives.

> **Level of scrutiny?**  
> – Implicitly **strict scrutiny**—though no tiered language yet.

> **Concurring opinions:**
> - **Goldberg**: Relied on **9th Amendment**, “retained rights” of the people.
> - **Harlan**: Located privacy in the **14th Amendment's Due Process Clause**, rooted in tradition and ordered liberty.
> - **White**: Saw no compelling interest justifying intrusion into intimate decisions. Applied **substantive due process**.

> **Dissents:**
> - **Black**: Warned against judicial overreach. No textual “right to privacy.”
> - **Stewart**: Called the law “uncommonly silly” but **constitutionally valid**.

> **Significance?**  
> – Created the **modern right to privacy**, forming the basis for later decisions on contraception, abortion, sexuality, and family life. Redefined how courts identify **unenumerated rights**.

### 2. Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973)

> **Facts?**  
> – Texas banned abortion except to save the mother’s life. Jane Roe (a pseudonym) challenged the law as unconstitutional.

> **Roe’s argument?**  
> – The abortion ban violated her **right to privacy and bodily autonomy**, grounded in **substantive due process**.

> **Texas’s argument?**  
> – Asserted three compelling interests:
> 1. **Moral preservation**
> 2. **Protection of potential life**
> 3. **Maternal health and medical integrity**

> **Holding?**  
> – **Yes**: The Court struck down the ban, recognizing **abortion as a fundamental right** under the **liberty component of the 14th Amendment Due Process Clause**.

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
> – _Griswold_, _Eisenstadt v. Baird_, _Skinner_, _Meyer_, _Pierce_.

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
> – Fourteenth Amendment, **Due Process Clause**.

> **Liberty interest?**  
> – Right to terminate a pregnancy as part of **personal bodily autonomy** and family life.

> **State action?**  
> – Texas criminal abortion statute.

> **Level of scrutiny?**  
> – **Strict scrutiny**: State must show compelling interest and narrow tailoring.

> **Trimester Framework (created by the Court):**
> - **1st trimester**: State has **no interest** to interfere.
> - **2nd trimester**: State may regulate for **maternal health**.
> - **3rd trimester**: State may regulate or **prohibit abortion**, except when mother’s life/health is at risk.

> **Significance?**  
> – _Roe_ defined **abortion as a constitutional right** and shaped 50 years of reproductive law. Created a sweeping judicial doctrine, yet also provoked **intense backlash** for being **doctrinally ambitious**.

### 3. Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992)

> **Facts?**  
> – Pennsylvania law imposed restrictions on abortion: informed consent, 24-hour waiting period, parental consent for minors, and **spousal notification**.

> **Planned Parenthood’s argument?**  
> – These requirements **unduly burdened** the right to choose abortion, violating _Roe_.

> **Pennsylvania’s argument?**  
> – Claimed the law supported **informed decision-making** and **respect for fetal life**.

> **Holding?**  
> – **Yes and No**: _Roe_ was reaffirmed, but the **trimester framework was replaced**. The Court upheld most provisions **except** the **spousal notification**, which it deemed an **undue burden**.

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
> – _Roe_, _Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health_, _Thornburgh_.

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
> – Fourteenth Amendment **Due Process Clause**.

> **Liberty interest?**  
> – Right to abortion as part of **bodily autonomy and personal decision-making**.

> **State action?**  
> – Pennsylvania’s abortion regulation statute.

> **Level of scrutiny?**  
> – **INTRODUCED the Undue Burden Test to REPLACE Strict Scrutiny**: A law is unconstitutional if it places a **substantial obstacle** in the path of a woman seeking an abortion **before fetal viability**.

> **Joint opinion (O’Connor, Kennedy, Souter):**  
> – Reaffirmed _Roe_'s “essential holding” on the **constitutional right**, but **retreated from strict scrutiny** in favor of **functional burden analysis**.  
> – Emphasized **stare decisis**: Legal stability matters even amid controversy.

> **Significance?**  
> – _Casey_ preserved abortion rights but narrowed them. It **institutionalized the "undue burden" standard**, which would be pivotal in future litigation.

### 4. Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, 597 U.S. ___ (2022)

> **Facts?**  
> – Mississippi law banned abortions after **15 weeks**, directly challenging the **viability line** of _Roe_ and _Casey_.

> **Jackson Women’s argument?**  
> – The law was clearly **unconstitutional under Casey**, which protected pre-viability abortion access.

> **Mississippi’s argument?**  
> – Urged the Court to **overrule Roe and Casey**, arguing abortion is **not a deeply rooted right** and should be left to the states.

> **Holding?**  
> – **No** constitutional right to abortion. Both _Roe_ and _Casey_ were **overruled**. The Court returned authority to the states.

> **Precedents the Court overruled?**  
> – Explicitly overruled _Roe v. Wade_ and _Planned Parenthood v. Casey_.

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
> – Fourteenth Amendment **does not protect abortion**, majority says.

> **Liberty interest?**  
> – **Not recognized**. Court said abortion is **not deeply rooted** in American tradition or history.

> **State action?**  
> – Mississippi statute banning abortion after 15 weeks.

> **Level of scrutiny?**  
> – **Rational basis review** now applies to abortion laws.

> **Majority (Alito):**  
> – Denounced Roe as “egregiously wrong from the start.”  
> – Rejected substantive due process for unenumerated rights not rooted in **history and tradition**.

> **Concurring (Thomas):**  
> – Suggested reconsidering other substantive due process precedents (_Griswold_, _Lawrence_, _Obergefell_).

> **Dissent (Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan):**  
> – Condemned the majority for destroying a liberty **central to women’s autonomy and equality**.

> **Significance?**  
> – **Most radical rollback of a constitutional right in modern history**. Reignited the **abortion-rights political fight** and redefined the limits of **substantive due process**.

### 5. Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535 (1942) — Bonus Case

> **Facts?**  
> – Oklahoma’s Habitual Criminal Sterilization Act allowed forced sterilization of certain repeat offenders. Jack Skinner was ordered sterilized after three theft convictions.

> **Skinner’s argument?**  
> – The law violated his **equal protection** and infringed a **fundamental liberty**: the right to **procreate**.

> **Oklahoma’s argument?**  
> – Argued sterilization served **eugenic goals** and targeted only certain “degenerate” traits.

> **Holding?**  
> – **Yes**: The law was struck down. Procreation is a **fundamental right**, and the law’s **arbitrary targeting** of some crimes (but not white-collar crimes) violated **equal protection**.

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
> – _Buck v. Bell_ (1927)—implicitly retreated from it without overruling.

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
> – Fourteenth Amendment **Equal Protection Clause**, with liberty implications.

> **Liberty interest?**  
> – **Fundamental right to procreate**, as part of human dignity and autonomy.

> **State action?**  
> – Oklahoma’s criminal sterilization statute.

> **Level of scrutiny?**  
> – Not named, but effectively **strict scrutiny** due to fundamental right.

> **Significance?**  
> – Laid the groundwork for **privacy, reproductive rights**, and later **substantive due process jurisprudence** (_Griswold_, _Roe_). First explicit recognition that **bodily autonomy and reproduction** are fundamental constitutional concerns.

### I. Case Notes

**1. Application of Stare Decisis in Abortion Cases:**

| **Stare Decisis Factor** | **Meaning**                                                                                            | **Application in Casey / Dobbs**                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Workability**          | Is the precedent administrable and logically coherent?                                                 | _Casey_ said _Roe_'s trimester framework wasn’t workable, but its **core liberty holding** was.  |
| **Reliance Interests**   | Have people built their lives and expectations around the decision?                                    | _Casey_ emphasized this for women and society. _Dobbs_ dismissed it as speculative.              |
| **Doctrinal Coherence**  | Is the precedent consistent with the rest of constitutional doctrine?                                  | _Dobbs_ said Roe/Casey were outliers in substantive due process.                                 |
| **Changed Facts**        | Have underlying social or scientific circumstances changed in a way that makes the precedent obsolete? | _Dobbs_ claimed medical advances justified new viability standards and state interest arguments. |

**2. Pros and Cons of Substantive Due Process and Bodily Autonomy:**

| **Theme**                          | **Proponents Say...**                                                                                              | **Critics Say...**                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Substantive Due Process**        | Essential to protect **unenumerated but deeply personal rights** from political interference.                      | Vague, historically ungrounded, allows courts to act like **unelected moral legislators**.                   |
| **Right to Privacy**               | Flows from a zone created by the **penumbras** of multiple Amendments (Griswold), later housed in **due process**. | No explicit right to privacy in the Constitution—makes it hard to cabin judicial power.                      |
| **Bodily Autonomy (Roe/Casey)**    | Reproductive freedom is central to **liberty, equality, and personal dignity**.                                    | The Constitution **says nothing about abortion**; should be **returned to state legislatures** (Dobbs view). |
| **Court’s Anti-Majoritarian Role** | Protects **individuals and minorities** from **popular tyranny**.                                                  | Undermines **democracy and public accountability** when based on vague or moral reasoning.                   |

**3. Key Distinction between Strict Scrutiny and Undue Burden:**

| **Strict Scrutiny**                                                        | **Undue Burden Test**                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| State must prove law is **narrowly tailored** to a **compelling** interest | Law is invalid **only if** it places a **substantial obstacle** in the path of a person seeking an abortion **before viability** |
| Extremely hard for state to win                                            | Much easier for state to justify regulation                                                                                      |
| Used in _Roe v. Wade_                                                      | Created in _Casey_ and applied to all post-viability abortion cases afterward                                                    |
| Treats abortion like a **fundamental right**                               | Treats abortion as a **protected liberty**, but with less robust protection than other fundamental rights                        |
> _Casey_ **downgraded** the level of judicial protection for abortion—not reversing _Roe_, but weakening it.

**4. Why the hell is Planned Parenthood involved in everything?**

Because they are:
- One of the **most prominent providers of abortion services** in the U.S.
- Constantly targeted by state laws trying to **regulate or restrict abortion access**
- Legally aggressive—**willing to sue states** the moment they pass a restrictive law

Think of them as:

> The **NAACP Legal Defense Fund of reproductive rights**: always in court, always fighting the cutting edge of the issue, always the named plaintiff.

That’s why you see:
- **Planned Parenthood v. Danforth** (1976)
- **Planned Parenthood v. Casey** (1992)
- **Planned Parenthood v. A, B, C...** in dozens of federal and state court

### XX. Additional Cases

### 1. Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972)

> **Facts?**  
> – William Baird was convicted under Massachusetts law for giving contraception to an unmarried woman. The law allowed contraception only for married couples.

> **Baird’s argument?**  
> – The law violated **Equal Protection** by discriminating between married and unmarried people in access to contraceptives.

> **Massachusetts’s argument?**  
> – Argued it was justified by morality-based regulation of **nonmarital sexual behavior**.

> **Holding?**  
> – **Yes**: The law was unconstitutional. The Court extended **Griswold’s privacy protection** to **unmarried individuals**.

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
> – _Griswold v. Connecticut_, emerging privacy and equality precedents.

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
> – **Equal Protection Clause** of the Fourteenth Amendment (majority); **privacy doctrine** also reinforced.

> **Liberty interest?**  
> – Right of **individuals, not just married couples**, to access contraception and control reproductive decisions.

> **State action?**  
> – State criminal statute restricting contraceptive distribution.

> **Level of scrutiny?**  
> – No formal tier, but **heightened scrutiny** implied.

> **Significance?**  
> – Cemented **individual privacy and reproductive autonomy**. Built the foundation for recognizing **abortion** as a private, personal right.

### 2. Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925)

> **Facts?**  
> – Oregon law mandated all children attend public schools, effectively banning private religious schooling. The Society of Sisters, a Catholic organization, sued.

> **Society’s argument?**  
> – The law violated parents’ **right to control their children’s upbringing and education**.

> **Oregon’s argument?**  
> – The state had an interest in promoting **standardized civic education** through public schools.

> **Holding?**  
> – **Yes**: The Court struck down the law, affirming the **liberty of parents** to choose religious and private schooling.

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
> – _Meyer v. Nebraska_, natural rights of family life.

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
> – Fourteenth Amendment **Due Process Clause**.

> **Liberty interest?**  
> – Parental autonomy in **directing children's education and moral development**.

> **State action?**  
> – Compulsory education law mandating exclusive public schooling.

> **Level of scrutiny?**  
> – No tiered language, but effectively **strict scrutiny** due to fundamental right.

> **Significance?**  
> – Established that **personal and family life decisions** fall within the realm of **protected liberty**, foundational to later privacy cases like _Griswold_ and _Casey_.

### 3. Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.S. 914 (2000)

> **Facts?**  
> – Nebraska banned a broadly defined “partial-birth abortion” procedure (D&E), with **no health exception**.

> **Carhart’s argument?**  
> – The law was **vague**, covered common procedures, and lacked a **health exception** required under _Casey_ and _Roe_.

> **Nebraska’s argument?**  
> – Claimed a compelling interest in banning a **“gruesome” method** of abortion and preserving fetal dignity.

> **Holding?**  
> – **Yes**: The Court struck down the law. It imposed an **undue burden** and was **constitutionally vague**.

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
> – _Casey_, _Roe_, _Doe v. Bolton_.

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
> – Fourteenth Amendment **Due Process Clause**.

> **Liberty interest?**  
> – Right to choose **safe, legal, and medically appropriate** abortion options.

> **State action?**  
> – Criminal statute banning abortion method without exception for health.

> **Level of scrutiny?**  
> – **Undue burden test** applied; **vagueness doctrine** also used.

> **Significance?**  
> – Reinforced **abortion access must include medical discretion** and **health exceptions**, even as public and legislative attacks intensified.

### 4. Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124 (2007)

> **Facts?**  
> – The federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act banned the same procedures at issue in _Stenberg_, but with **more specific definitions**. Still **no health exception**.

> **Carhart’s argument?**  
> – The ban was functionally identical to the one struck down in _Stenberg_ and placed an **undue burden** on women.

> **Government’s argument?**  
> – The statute was **narrower**, provided clearer guidance, and protected **women and fetal dignity**. Congress determined women could suffer **psychological harm**.

> **Holding?**  
> – **No** violation: The Court upheld the law, shifting away from _Stenberg_ and **reducing medical deference**.

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
> – Cited _Casey_, but **reinterpreted it narrowly**. Distinguished from _Stenberg_ on definitional grounds.

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
> – Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause—but now applied with more **deference to legislative findings**.

> **Liberty interest?**  
> – Diminished—Court emphasized **state’s interest in protecting women and fetal life**.

> **State action?**  
> – Federal statute banning specified abortion method.

> **Level of scrutiny?**  
> – Undue burden test, but **more deferential**—suggesting a **weakened form of scrutiny**.

> **Significance?**  
> – **Marked a doctrinal shift**: Court was now more willing to uphold **restrictive abortion laws**, especially under **Roberts/Alito** Court. Justice Ginsburg dissented forcefully:
> 
> > “Reflects ancient notions about women’s place… ideas long discredited.”

### 5. Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179 (1973) — _Roe’s Companion Case_

> **Facts?**  
> – Georgia law required multiple procedural barriers to abortion (hospital committees, multiple doctors, etc.) and narrowly defined **"health"** exceptions.

> **Doe’s argument?**  
> – The law’s health restriction and procedural hurdles **violated liberty and privacy rights** protected under _Roe_.

> **Georgia’s argument?**  
> – Sought to **regulate abortion for safety** and protect medical ethics.

> **Holding?**  
> – **Yes**: The law was struck down. The Court **broadly defined “health”**, ruling it must include:
> 
> > “All factors—physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman’s age…”

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
> – _Roe v. Wade_, _Griswold_, _Casey_ (retroactively cited in later cases).

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
> – Fourteenth Amendment **Due Process Clause**.

> **Liberty interest?**  
> – Right to abortion access with **comprehensive medical discretion**.

> **State action?**  
> – Georgia’s procedural abortion restrictions and narrow health definition.

> **Level of scrutiny?**  
> – Strict scrutiny at the time, consistent with _Roe_'s framework.

> **Significance?**  
> – Defined the **“health exception” standard** still cited in later litigation. Courts would wrestle over whether this included **mental and social well-being**, or only **physical survival**.

### 6. **Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52 (1976)

> **Facts?**  
> – Missouri enacted a law requiring **spousal and parental consent** for abortions, banned **certain procedures** (e.g., saline amniocentesis), and demanded physicians **preserve the life of the fetus** at all stages.

> **Petitioner’s argument?**  
> – The law violated a woman’s **fundamental right to abortion**, as recognized in _Roe_, by giving third parties **veto power** over her personal decision.

> **Missouri’s argument?**  
> – Claimed an interest in **protecting fetal life**, promoting **parental involvement**, and **preserving marital interests** in family decisions.

> **Issue?**  
> – Whether spousal/parental consent laws and method bans **violate the constitutional right to abortion** under _Roe v. Wade_.

> **Holding?**  
> – **Yes**:
> - **Spousal consent** requirement = **unconstitutional**.
> - **Parental consent** for minors = **struck down** (as written, because it gave parents an absolute veto).
> - **Ban on saline method** = **invalid**.
> - **Physician’s duty to preserve fetal life at all stages** = **overbroad and unconstitutional**.

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
> – _Roe v. Wade_, _Doe v. Bolton_.

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
> – Fourteenth Amendment **Due Process Clause** (substantive liberty).

> **Liberty interest?**  
> – A woman’s **personal and medical autonomy** in making abortion decisions, free from unjustified third-party interference.

> **Level of scrutiny?**  
> – Applied **strict scrutiny** consistent with _Roe_.

> **Significance?**  
> – Reaffirmed that the **abortion decision rests with the pregnant person**, not the spouse or parents. State cannot use **procedural gatekeeping** to undermine constitutional liberty.

### 7. **City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 462 U.S. 416 (1983)

> **Facts?**  
> – Akron passed a law requiring:
> - A **24-hour waiting period** after receiving **state-mandated anti-abortion counseling**.
> - That all abortions **after the first trimester** be performed in **hospitals** (not clinics).
> - **Parental consent** for minors without judicial bypass.
> - Special regulations on **fetal disposal**.

> **Clinic’s argument?**  
> – These provisions were designed not to promote safety, but to **deter abortion**, violating the substantive due process rights recognized in _Roe_.

> **Akron’s argument?**  
> – Claimed the requirements promoted **informed decision-making**, **protect fetal life**, and **ensure safety and professionalism**.

> **Issue?**  
> – Whether these **procedural and physical burdens** on abortion access were consistent with _Roe’s_ protections.

> **Holding?**  
> – **Yes, the law was unconstitutional**:
> - **24-hour delay** = invalid, as it served **no compelling interest** and created obstacles.
> - **Hospital-only rule** = struck down; **clinics** are often medically sufficient.
> - **Parental consent** = unconstitutional due to **lack of judicial bypass**.
> - **Biased counseling** = violated **informed consent standards**.

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
> – _Roe v. Wade_, _Planned Parenthood v. Danforth_, _Doe v. Bolton_.

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
> – Fourteenth Amendment **Due Process Clause**.

> **Liberty interest?**  
> – Right to obtain abortion free from **state-imposed delays, manipulation, or unnecessary clinical restrictions**.

> **Level of scrutiny?**  
> – **Strict scrutiny**, consistent with pre-_Casey_ doctrine.

> **Significance?**  
> – Expanded the protection of **abortion access** by invalidating **indirect deterrence mechanisms**. Later partially reversed in _Casey_, which permitted some delays and regulations under a looser **undue burden** standard.

## Week 3.2 -- Intimate Association

Fundamental Right to Privacy → Intimate Association and Bodily Autonomy

> The Constitution protects **zones of personal autonomy**—particularly concerning **marriage, sex, procreation, family, and bodily integrity**—under a doctrine of **substantive due process** rooted in the **Fourteenth Amendment**.

### 1. Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967)

> **Facts?**  
> – A Virginia law criminalized interracial marriage. Mildred Jeter (Black woman) and Richard Loving (white man) married in D.C., returned to Virginia, and were arrested. They received suspended sentences contingent on leaving the state for 25 years.

> **Petitioners’ argument?**  
> – The law violated the **Equal Protection Clause** and infringed their **fundamental liberty to marry** under the **Due Process Clause**.

> **Virginia’s argument?**  
> – Argued the law punished both races equally and reflected the state's interest in **preserving racial integrity** and social order.

> **Issue?**  
> – Does a state law banning interracial marriage violate the **Fourteenth Amendment**?

> **Holding?**  
> – **Yes**: The law was struck down as both an **equal protection** and **substantive due process** violation.

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
> – _Skinner v. Oklahoma_ (procreation and marriage as fundamental), _Brown v. Board of Education_.

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
> – Fourteenth Amendment: **Equal Protection** and **Due Process Clauses**.

> **Liberty interest?**  
> – **Fundamental right to marry**, regardless of race—deeply rooted in American history and tradition.

> **Level of scrutiny?**  
> – Applied **strict scrutiny** for racial classifications and fundamental rights.

> **Significance?**  
> – Landmark decision establishing that **marriage is a fundamental right**, and that laws based on **racial classifications** are presumptively unconstitutional. Key precedent for later **same-sex marriage litigation**.

### 2. Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986)

> **Facts?**  
> – Michael Hardwick was criminally charged under Georgia’s sodomy law after police found him engaging in consensual sex with another man in his own home.

> **Hardwick’s argument?**  
> – Claimed the law violated his **fundamental right to privacy** in intimate relationships and bodily autonomy.

> **Georgia’s argument?**  
> – Argued the state had a legitimate interest in **preserving public morality**, and sodomy was **not a deeply rooted constitutional liberty**.

> **Issue?**  
> – Does the Constitution protect the **right of consenting adults to engage in homosexual sex in private**?

> **Holding?**  
> – **No**: The Court upheld the sodomy law, holding that the Constitution does **not** protect homosexual conduct as a **fundamental right**.

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
> – Distinguished from _Griswold_, _Eisenstadt_, _Roe_, claiming those involved heterosexual or procreative activity.

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
> – Fourteenth Amendment **Due Process Clause**—**rejected** as applicable here.

> **Liberty interest?**  
> – **Not recognized**: The Court refused to treat same-sex intimacy as constitutionally protected.

> **Level of scrutiny?**  
> – **Rational basis**—deference to the legislature’s moral judgment.

> **Significance?**  
> – One of the most criticized decisions of the Burger Court era. Marked a **deep retreat from privacy jurisprudence**. Overruled 17 years later in _Lawrence v. Texas_.

### 3. Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003)

> **Facts?**  
> – Lawrence and another man were arrested in Texas for violating the state’s “Homosexual Conduct” law. Unlike Georgia’s sodomy law, Texas's law **only criminalized same-sex sexual conduct**.

> **Petitioners’ argument?**  
> – Argued the law violated their **liberty and privacy** under the **Due Process Clause**, and possibly the **Equal Protection Clause**.

> **Texas’s argument?**  
> – Claimed a legitimate interest in preserving **traditional morality**.

> **Issue?**  
> – Does criminalizing **private, consensual same-sex conduct** violate the **Fourteenth Amendment’s liberty protections**?

> **Holding?**  
> – **Yes**: The Texas law was struck down. The Court explicitly **overruled Bowers** and declared that **the state cannot criminalize private consensual intimacy** between adults.

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
> – _Griswold_, _Roe_, _Casey_, _Eisenstadt_, and foreign decisions recognizing sexual privacy (e.g., European Court rulings).

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
> – Fourteenth Amendment **Due Process Clause**.

> **Liberty interest?**  
> – **Right to engage in private, consensual sexual conduct** without state interference.

> **Level of scrutiny?**  
> – No explicit tier; applied a **robust form of rational basis** bordering on **heightened scrutiny**.

> **Significance?**  
> – Reversed _Bowers_ and **reaffirmed that liberty includes intimate choices** related to identity and autonomy. Set the stage for **Obergefell** by recognizing dignity and equality in private relationships.

### 4. Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644 (2015)

> **Facts?**  
> – Plaintiffs from several states challenged state bans on same-sex marriage, arguing they violated **fundamental liberty** and **equal protection**.

> **Petitioners’ argument?**  
> – Same-sex couples have a **fundamental right to marry**, just as in _Loving_. Denial of that right violates both **Due Process** and **Equal Protection**.

> **States’ argument?**  
> – Marriage traditionally involved only **heterosexual unions**; states had interests in **children’s welfare**, **tradition**, and **democratic self-governance**.

> **Issue?**  
> – Do state bans on **same-sex marriage** violate the **Fourteenth Amendment**?

> **Holding?**  
> – **Yes**: Same-sex couples have a **fundamental right to marry**, and state bans violate both the **Due Process Clause** and the **Equal Protection Clause**.

> **Precedents the Court looked to?**  
> – _Loving_, _Griswold_, _Lawrence_, _Zablocki v. Redhail_, _Turner v. Safley_.

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
> – Fourteenth Amendment **Due Process** and **Equal Protection Clauses**.

> **Liberty interest?**  
> – Right to **marry the person of one’s choice**, regardless of sex or gender.

> **Level of scrutiny?**  
> – No tier named, but treated as a **fundamental right**, so effectively **strict scrutiny**.

> **Significance?**  
> – Landmark case recognizing **marriage equality**. Cemented that **intimate association and dignity** are central to liberty and equality. Opponents criticized it as **judicial activism**, but it built directly on the logic of _Loving_, _Griswold_, and _Lawrence_.

|**Case**|**Right Recognized / Denied**|**Scrutiny Applied**|**Significance**|
|---|---|---|---|
|_Loving v. Virginia_|Right to interracial marriage|**Strict scrutiny**|Marriage = fundamental right, racial equality central to equal protection|
|_Bowers v. Hardwick_|Denied right to same-sex intimacy|**Rational basis**|Retreat from privacy; upheld state moral laws (later overruled)|
|_Lawrence v. Texas_|Right to private same-sex sexual intimacy|Unnamed, but heightened|Overruled _Bowers_; key moment for LGBTQ+ liberty and sexual privacy|
|_Obergefell v. Hodges_|Right to same-sex marriage|Effectively strict scrutiny|Marriage equality grounded in both **liberty** and **equality**|

## Week 3 Additional Notes

### I. Eras of the Supreme Court

**Criteria:**
- **Judicial temperament** (activist, minimalist, restrained, ideological, institutionalist)
- **Era** and **context** (economic liberty vs. civil rights vs. culture wars)
- **Alignment** on major doctrines (substantive due process, privacy, abortion, marriage, etc.)

#### I. The Lochner Era (1897–1937): Conservative Economic Libertarians

**Key Justices:**
- **Justice Rufus Peckham** (author of _Lochner v. New York_)  
    → Zealous defender of **economic liberty** and **freedom of contract**  
    → Treated market autonomy as sacred; deeply hostile to government regulation
- **Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes (Dissent)**  
    → Famous for warning: _“The Constitution does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer’s Social Statics.”_  
    → Advocated **judicial restraint** and **pluralism**, not libertarianism

**Temperament:**  
🟥 **Hyper-conservative in economics**, but _not_ socially moralistic.  
The Court was **activist** in **striking down regulations**, not in enforcing morality.

#### II. The New Deal & Warren Court (1937–1969): Liberal Ascendancy

**Chief Justices:**
- **Charles Evans Hughes** (1930s)  
    → Presided over the **“switch in time”** that ended Lochnerism  
    → Upheld New Deal legislation, giving birth to the **modern regulatory state**
- **Earl Warren** (1953–1969)  
    → Architect of the **civil rights revolution** (_Brown v. Board_, _Miranda_, _Loving_)  
    → Promoted **egalitarianism**, **due process**, **liberty**, and **equality**

**Key Liberal Justices:**
- **William Brennan**  
    → Intellectual engine behind **substantive due process** and **equal protection expansion**  
    → Crafted rights-based doctrine in _Eisenstadt_, _Roe_, _Goldberg v. Kelly_
- **Thurgood Marshall**  
    → Civil rights giant, first Black Justice  
    → Prioritized **dignity**, **equal access**, and **racial justice**

**Temperament:**  
🟩 **Liberal activist** court, unafraid to reshape American law in favor of **individual rights** and **social progress**.

#### III. The Burger Court (1969–1986): Transitional & Divided

**Chief Justice Warren Burger**  
→ Publicly conservative, but the Court delivered **liberal rulings in privacy and abortion** (_Roe_, _Eisenstadt_, _Furman_)

**Key Swing Justices:**
- **Lewis Powell**  
    → Voted with majority in _Roe_, authored _Bakke_, but backed _Bowers v. Hardwick_  
    → **Elite moderate conservative**, reflective of establishment Republicanism
- **Harry Blackmun**  
    → Authored _Roe v. Wade_, moved steadily **leftward over time**, especially on **gender and liberty**

**Temperament:**  
🟨 Transitional—split between **liberal remnants** of Warren Court and **emerging conservatism**.  
Court was **pragmatic**, **incremental**, and **ideologically messy**.

#### IV. The Rehnquist Court (1986–2005): Conservative Consolidation

**Chief Justice William Rehnquist**  
→ Philosophically opposed to **expansive liberty claims**, **federal power**, and **broad rights**  
→ Authored or joined in **narrowing Roe**, limiting civil rights remedies, favoring **states’ rights**

**Key Conservatives:**
- **Antonin Scalia**  
    → Originalist bulldog, **anti-substantive due process**, hostile to Roe, _Lawrence_, _Obergefell_
    → Fiery dissents, full of sarcasm and ideological clarity
- **Clarence Thomas**  
    → Even more radical than Scalia—hostile to privacy doctrine, due process, and even Griswold  
    → Willing to **reverse decades of precedent** with glee

**Key Moderates / Liberals:**
- **Sandra Day O’Connor**  
    → Pragmatist; authored _Casey_ joint opinion  
    → Valued **stability, compromise**, and **incrementalism**
- **John Paul Stevens**  
    → Technocratic, pro-liberty liberal  
    → Often joined dissents in _Bowers_, _Gonzales v. Carhart_

**Temperament:**  
🟥 **Ideologically shifting**: From liberal remnants to a **disciplined, rights-skeptical conservatism**, but with **pragmatic moderates** still holding the center.

#### V. The Roberts Court (2005–Present): Hyperpolarization & Doctrinal Retrenchment

**Chief Justice John Roberts**  
→ Claims institutionalism, but often **votes conservative** on substance (e.g., _Dobbs_)  
→ Strategically moderates optics, not outcomes

**Hardline Conservatives:**
- **Samuel Alito**  
    → Architect of _Dobbs_, relentless in attacking Roe, Casey, Griswold  
    → Views **abortion, LGBTQ rights, and privacy** as judicial overreach
- **Neil Gorsuch**  
    → Libertarian leanings, but **firmly originalist**  
    → Surprisingly progressive on **Native rights**, but not abortion
- **Brett Kavanaugh**  
    → Institutionalist posture, but **voted to overturn Roe**  
    → Seeks moderation in tone, not in outcome
- **Amy Coney Barrett**  
    → Deeply conservative Catholic legal theorist  
    → Firm on **religious liberty**, **abortion restrictions**, and **textualism**

**Liberal Wing:**
- **Sonia Sotomayor**  
    → Moral conscience of the Court. **Fiercely defends bodily autonomy, race equity, and procedural justice**  
    → Dissents in _Dobbs_, _Carhart_, _Kennedy v. Bremerton_ blister with **righteous fire**
- **Elena Kagan**  
    → Brilliant writer, institutionalist liberal  
    → Focuses on **administrative law, precedent, and First Amendment**
- **Ketanji Brown Jackson**  
    → Early signs of sharp intellect + progressive values  
    → Will likely continue **Sotomayor’s legacy** on race, gender, and power

**Temperament:**  
🟥🟩 **Polarized to the extreme**.  
**No center remains**. Court swings based on **personnel changes**, not **doctrinal consistency**.  
Culture wars dominate—privacy, abortion, voting, race, and religion are **constitutional battlegrounds**.

#### Most Liberal Justices (Civil Rights & Liberties)

- **William Brennan**
- **Thurgood Marshall**
- **Ruth Bader Ginsburg**
- **Sonia Sotomayor**
- **John Paul Stevens** (later years)

### II. ACLU Comment on Laken Riley Act

- - **Mandatory Detention Without Charge or Hearing**:  
    The Act mandates detention of any noncitizen who **admits to having committed conduct that constitutes the essential elements** of burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting—**regardless of whether they were ever charged, arrested, or convicted** in any jurisdiction. This **pre-criminal, hearsay-based detention regime** raises grave **due process concerns**.
- **No Hearing, No Judge, No Charge—Just Indefinite Detention**:  
    The Act allows detention even where **an immigration judge expressly disagrees**, and without requiring any arrest or formal adjudication. Such authority **circumvents core procedural protections** guaranteed under the **Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause**, and resembles detention schemes **previously invalidated** by the Supreme Court (_Hamdi v. Rumsfeld_, _Foucha v. Louisiana_).
- **Expansive, Vague, and Unconstitutional**:  
    The language is **overbroad**, covering vague “admissions” and conduct from any jurisdiction, regardless of legal definitions or cultural context. Such vagueness **invites arbitrary enforcement**, violates fair notice principles, and runs afoul of the **void for vagueness doctrine** (_Papachristou v. Jacksonville_, _Kolender v. Lawson_).
- **Improper State Enforcement of Federal Immigration Law**:  
    The Act grants **standing and enforcement powers** to **state attorneys general** and other non-federal actors. This **conflicts with Supreme Court precedent** that immigration regulation is an **exclusive federal function** (_Arizona v. United States_, _United States v. Texas_). Under _Spokeo v. Robins_, Congress **cannot manufacture standing** by statutory fiat without a **concrete and particularized injury**.
- **False "Open Border" Narrative Refuted by DHS Data**:  
    Contrary to political rhetoric, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data shows that **immigrant removals from May to November 2023 were on par with or exceeded those from 2019**, and surpassed all totals from 2015 to 2018. **Daily removals nearly doubled** compared to pre-pandemic averages (2014–2019). The notion of an "open border" is not supported by empirical enforcement metrics.
- Relevant Court Cases below.

### 1. **United States v. Texas** (599 U.S. ___, 2023)

- **Facts**: Texas and Louisiana challenged Biden administration’s immigration enforcement guidelines that prioritized deporting noncitizens who were a threat to public safety or national security, rather than everyone eligible for removal.
- **Holding**: The Court dismissed for **lack of standing**—states cannot sue the federal government just because they disagree with enforcement priorities.
- **Right / Principle**: **Article III standing** requires a concrete, judicially cognizable injury—not a political or administrative grievance.
- **Significance**: Limits **state standing** to challenge **federal immigration discretion**. Weakens Laken Riley Act’s idea that **state attorneys general** can act as independent enforcers of federal immigration laws.
- **Era**: **Roberts Court**, 2023

### 2. **Hamdi v. Rumsfeld** (542 U.S. 507 (2004))

- **Facts**: Yaser Hamdi, a U.S. citizen, was detained indefinitely as an “enemy combatant” without charge or trial after being captured in Afghanistan.
- **Holding**: The Court held that **even enemy combatants have due process rights**. Hamdi was entitled to a meaningful opportunity to contest his detention before a neutral decisionmaker.
- **Right / Principle**: **Due Process Clause (Fifth Amendment)** applies to detention, even in wartime.
- **Significance**: Undermines any notion that immigrants—**even noncitizens**—can be detained **indefinitely and without hearing**, as the Laken Riley Act proposes.
- **Era**: **Rehnquist Court**, 2004

### 3. **Foucha v. Louisiana** (504 U.S. 71 (1992))

- **Facts**: A man found not guilty by reason of insanity was kept in custody even after no longer being mentally ill, solely because he was deemed dangerous.
- **Holding**: **Indefinite civil detention** based solely on **dangerousness**, without mental illness or criminal charge, violates due process.
- **Right / Principle**: **Liberty deprivation** must be tied to **mental illness or criminal charge**, not mere speculative risk.
- **Significance**: Laken Riley Act proposes **mandatory detention based on past conduct or suspicion**, not mental illness or crime—**Foucha** makes clear this is **constitutionally invalid**.
- **Era**: **Rehnquist Court**, 1992

### 4. **Covington v. Harris** (419 F.2d 617 (D.C. Cir. 1969))
_(Note: Not a SCOTUS case, but cited frequently in due process litigation)_

- **Facts**: Plaintiff, declared mentally ill, challenged indefinite confinement after recovery.
- **Holding**: Continued civil commitment must have procedural safeguards and must not be punitive.
- **Right / Principle**: Due process protections for civil liberty apply to **non-criminal detentions**.
- **Significance**: Emphasizes procedural checks on **detention without current justification**—challenges Riley Act’s **open-ended detention framework**.

### 5. **Shelton v. Tucker** (364 U.S. 479 (1960))

- **Facts**: Arkansas required teachers to disclose all organizational affiliations. A teacher who refused was dismissed.
- **Holding**: The law violated **First Amendment freedom of association**. It was not narrowly tailored and chilled expressive rights.
- **Right / Principle**: Government cannot condition employment or freedom on sweeping disclosure or **associational guilt**.
- **Significance**: Riley Act’s targeting of people who have “admitted to” certain past conduct (even uncharged) resembles **guilt by association**, not valid individualized due process.
- **Era**: **Warren Court**, 1960

### 6. **Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins** (578 U.S. 330 (2016))

- **Facts**: Plaintiff sued for statutory violation (under the FCRA) but could not show any concrete harm.
- **Holding**: **Statutory violation alone is not enough**—plaintiff must show **concrete injury** to satisfy **Article III standing**.
- **Right / Principle**: **Congress cannot create standing out of thin air**. A real injury is needed for federal court jurisdiction.
- **Significance**: Crucially undermines Laken Riley Act’s provision that **state attorneys general can be given standing by Congress**—**Spokeo** says that violates Article III limits.
- **Era**: **Roberts Court**, 2016

### 7. **Arizona v. United States** (567 U.S. 387 (2012))

- **Facts**: Arizona passed SB 1070, a law trying to enforce its own immigration rules. The federal government sued.
- **Holding**: Most of the law was **preempted** by federal immigration law. Immigration enforcement is a **federal power**, not state.
- **Right / Principle**: The **Supremacy Clause** makes federal immigration policy supreme. States cannot create parallel enforcement regimes.
- **Significance**: **Crushes the legal foundation of the Riley Act’s state enforcement authority**. States cannot unilaterally detain or prosecute immigration violations.
- **Era**: **Roberts Court**, 2012

### 8. **De Canas v. Bica** (424 U.S. 351 (1976))

- **Facts**: California law prohibited employers from hiring undocumented workers. Challenged as preempted by federal immigration law.
- **Holding**: The law was upheld at the time—Court said it targeted **employment** and **was not field preempted**.
- **Right / Principle**: States can act on **employment-related immigration effects**, but not directly regulate **entry, detention, or removal**.
- **Significance**: Often **misused** by proponents of state power in immigration. But post-_Arizona_, its scope is narrow. Riley Act’s **detention regime** goes far beyond _De Canas_.
- **Era**: **Burger Court**, 1976

### 🚨 Summary: Why These Cases Undermine the Laken Riley Act

- **Standing** (_United States v. Texas_, _Spokeo_):  
    → States and Congress **cannot manufacture standing** without a real, personal injury.
- **Due Process / Detention** (_Hamdi_, _Foucha_, _Covington_):  
    → **Detaining people without charge**, based on vague categories or past admissions, is **unconstitutional**.
- **Federalism** (_Arizona_, _De Canas_):  
    → Immigration enforcement is a **federal domain**. The Riley Act’s grant of power to state attorneys general **violates supremacy principles**.
- **Civil Liberties** (_Shelton_):  
    → Detaining people for past behavior, associations, or admissions with no judicial finding **chills liberty** and invokes guilt-by-inference.

### III. No, there’s no “hate speech” exception to the First Amendment -- Eugene Volokh

I keep hearing about a supposed “hate speech” exception to the First Amendment, or statements such as, “This isn’t free speech, it’s hate speech,” or “When does free speech stop and hate speech begin?” But there is no hate speech exception to the First Amendment. Hateful ideas (whatever exactly that might mean) are just as protected under the First Amendment as other ideas. One is as free to condemn Islam — or Muslims, or Jews, or blacks, or whites, or illegal aliens, or native-born citizens — as one is to condemn capitalism or Socialism or Democrats or Republicans.

To be sure, there are some kinds of speech that are unprotected by the First Amendment. But those narrow exceptions have nothing to do with “hate speech” in any conventionally used sense of the term. For instance, there is an exception for “fighting words” — face-to-face personal insults addressed to a specific person, of the sort that are likely to start an immediate fight. But this exception isn’t limited to racial or religious insults, nor does it cover all racially or religiously offensive statements. Indeed, when the City of St. Paul tried to specifically punish bigoted fighting words, the Supreme Court held that this selective prohibition was unconstitutional (_R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul_ (1992)), even though a broad ban on all fighting words would indeed be permissible. (And, notwithstanding CNN anchor Chris Cuomo’s [Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChrisCuomo/status/595934009764487168) that “hate speech is excluded from protection,” and his later claims that by “hate speech” he means “fighting words,” the fighting words exception is not generally labeled a “hate speech” exception, and isn’t coextensive with any established definition of “hate speech” that I know of.)

The same is true of the other narrow exceptions, such as for true threats of illegal conduct or incitement intended to and likely to produce imminent illegal conduct (i.e., illegal conduct in the next few hours or maybe days, as opposed to some illegal conduct some time in the future). Indeed, threatening to kill someone because he’s black (or white), or intentionally inciting someone to a likely and immediate attack on someone because he’s Muslim (or Christian or Jewish), can be made a crime. But this isn’t because it’s “hate speech”; it’s because it’s illegal to make true threats and incite imminent crimes against anyone and for any reason, for instance because they are police officers or capitalists or just someone who is sleeping with the speaker’s ex-girlfriend.

The Supreme Court did, in _Beauharnais v. Illinois_ (1952), uphold a “group libel” law that outlawed statements that expose racial or religious groups to contempt or hatred, unless the speaker could show that the statements were true, and were said with “good motives” and for “justifiable ends.” But this too was treated by the Court as just a special case of a broader First Amendment exception — the one for libel generally. And _Beauharnais_ is widely understood to no longer be good law, given the Court’s restrictions on the libel exception. 
- See _New York Times Co. v. Sullivan_ (1964) (rejecting the view that libel is categorically unprotected, and holding that the libel exception requires a showing that the libelous accusations be “of and concerning” a particular person); 
- _Garrison v. Louisiana_ (1964) (generally rejecting the view that a defense of truth can be limited to speech that is said for “good motives” and for “justifiable ends”); 
- _Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps_ (1986) (generally rejecting the view that the burden of proving truth can be placed on the defendant); 
- _R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul_ (1992) (holding that singling bigoted speech is unconstitutional, even when that speech fits within a First Amendment exception); 
- _Nuxoll ex rel. Nuxoll v. Indian Prairie Sch. Dist. # 204_, 523 F.3d 668, 672 (7th Cir. 2008) (concluding that _Beauharnais_ is no longer good law); 
- _Dworkin v. Hustler Magazine Inc._, 867 F.2d 1188, 1200 (9th Cir. 1989) (likewise); 
- _Am. Booksellers Ass’n, Inc. v. Hudnut_, 771 F.2d 323, 331 n.3 (7th Cir. 1985) (likewise); 
- _Collin v. Smith_, 578 F.2d 1197, 1205 (7th Cir. 1978) (likewise); 
- _Tollett v. United States_, 485 F.2d 1087, 1094 n.14 (8th Cir. 1973) (likewise); 

- Erwin Chemerinsky, _Constitutional Law: Principles and Policies_ 1043-45 (4th ed. 2011); 
- Laurence Tribe, _Constitutional Law,_ §12-17, at 926; 
- Toni M. Massaro, _Equality and Freedom of Expression: The Hate Speech Dilemma_, 32 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 211, 219 (1991); 
- Robert C. Post, _Cultural Heterogeneity and Law: Pornography, Blasphemy, and the First Amendment_, 76 Calif. L. Rev. 297, 330-31 (1988).

Finally, “hostile environment harassment law” has sometimes been read as applying civil liability — or administrative discipline by universities — to allegedly bigoted speech in workplaces, universities, and places of public accommodation. There is a hot debate on whether those restrictions are indeed constitutional; they have generally been held unconstitutional when applied to universities, but decisions are mixed as to civil liability based on speech that creates hostile environments in workplaces (see [the pages linked to at this site](http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/harass) for more information on the subject). But even when those restrictions have been upheld, they have been justified precisely on the rationale that they do not criminalize speech (or otherwise punish it) in society at large, ==but only apply to particular contexts,== such as workplaces. ==None of them represent a “hate speech” exception, nor have they been defined in terms of “hate speech.”==

For this very reason, “hate speech” also doesn’t have any fixed legal meaning under U.S. law. U.S. law has just never had occasion to define “hate speech” — any more than it has had occasion to define rudeness, evil ideas, unpatriotic speech, or any other kind of speech that people might condemn but that does not constitute a legally relevant category.

Of course, one can certainly argue that First Amendment law _should_ be changed to allow bans on hate speech (whether [bigoted speech](http://volokh.com/2012/09/13/former-yale-dean-harold-koh-now-attorney-advisor-at-the-state-department-on/), [blasphemy](http://volokh.com/2012/10/01/organization-of-islamic-conference-head-calls-for-a-global-ban-on-offending-the-character-of-the-prophet-muhammad/), [blasphemy to which foreigners may respond with attacks on Americans](http://volokh.com/2012/09/13/prof-peter-spiro-on-why-hate-speech-should-be-banned-and-on-how-it-might-be-done/) or blasphemy or [flag burning](http://volokh.com/2009/05/14/flag-desecration-and-hate-speech/) or anything else). Perhaps some statements of the “This isn’t free speech, it’s hate speech” variety are deliberate attempts to call for such an exception, though my sense is that they are usually (incorrect) claims that the exception already exists.

I think no such exception should be recognized, but of course, like all questions about what the law ought to be, this is a matter that can be debated. Indeed, people have a First Amendment right to call for speech restrictions, just as they have a First Amendment right to call for gun bans or bans on Islam or government-imposed race discrimination or anything else that current constitutional law forbids. Constitutional law is no more set in stone than any other law.

But those who want to make such arguments should acknowledge that they are calling for a change in First Amendment law, and should explain just what that change would be, so people can thoughtfully evaluate it. Calls for a new First Amendment exception for “hate speech” shouldn’t just rely on the undefined term “hate speech” — they should explain just what viewpoints the government would be allowed to suppress, what viewpoints would remain protected, and how judges, juries, and prosecutors are supposed to distinguish the two. Saying “this isn’t free speech, it’s hate speech” doesn’t, I think, suffice.

### Summary:

<u>i. Basic Legal Framework</u>
- U.S. law does **not recognize “hate speech” as a separate category of unprotected speech**. Offensive, hateful, or even racist expression is protected unless it falls into a **recognized exception** (like true threats, incitement, or harassment in a regulated setting).
- There is **no legal definition of “hate speech”** under federal law.
- All exceptions must be:
	- **Narrowly defined**
	- **Content-neutral** (except in rare categories like incitement)
	- **Historically rooted**

<u>ii. On Libel</u>
- **Libel** is a form of **defamation**—specifically, **written or published false statements** that **harm someone's reputation**.
	- If spoken, it’s called **slander**.
	- If written (newspaper, book, online post, TV caption, etc.), it’s **libel**.
	- **Libel = Defamation in a fixed medium** that damages a person’s **reputation**, **livelihood**, or **public standing**.
- Elements of a Libel claim: 
	- The **plaintiff (the person suing)** generally must prove:
	- **False Statement of Fact**  
	    The statement must be **objectively false**, not just an opinion or insult.
	- **Publication**  
	    It must be communicated to **someone other than the plaintiff** (e.g., in a newspaper, blog, social media, etc.).
	- **Identification**  
	    The plaintiff must be **specifically identifiable**, either by name or clear reference.
	- **Harm to Reputation**  
	    The statement must have caused **actual reputational or economic harm** (sometimes presumed).
	- **Fault**
	    - If the plaintiff is a **private figure**, negligence may be enough.
	    - If the plaintiff is a **public figure or public official**, they must prove **“actual malice”** — meaning the speaker **knew it was false** or **acted with reckless disregard for the truth**.

| **Civil Rights Traditionalists (e.g., NAACP Legal Defense Fund)** | Cautious. Prefer **reinterpretation**, not rewriting—fearing minority protections may be lost in new negotiations.                                              |

## Week 4.1

### 1. Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896)

> **Facts?**  
>  – Louisiana’s 1890 “Separate Car Act” required railroads to provide "equal but separate" coaches for white and Black passengers.  
>  – Civil‑rights activists (the Citizens’ Committee of New Orleans) recruited **Homer Plessy**—a light‑skinned Creole who was 7⁄8 white—to purchase a first‑class whites‑only ticket and refuse to move.  
>  – He was arrested by pre‑arrangement, convicted in state court, and fined $25.

> **Plessy’s argument?**  
>  – Segregation laws violate the **Thirteenth Amendment** (badge of servitude) and the **Equal Protection Clause** by creating a caste system based on race.

> **Louisiana’s argument?**  
>  – The statute is a valid exercise of the state’s **police power** to preserve public order. Separate facilities do not imply Black inferiority if they are "equal."  
>  – The 14th Amendment was never intended to abolish social distinctions.

> **Issue?**  
>  – Does a state law mandating racial segregation on common carriers violate the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause or the Thirteenth Amendment?

> **Holding?**  
>  – **No.** Segregation is constitutional so long as the facilities are "equal" in quality—birth of the **“separate‑but‑equal”** doctrine.

> **Reasoning (Justice Brown):**  
>  – The 14th Amendment guarantees legal—not social—equality.  
>  – Segregation does not, per se, stamp the Black race with a badge of inferiority; any such feeling "is due solely to that race’s interpretation."  
>  – The law applies equally to both races (both are punished for entering the "wrong" coach).

> **Dissent (Justice Harlan):**  
>  – **Color‑blind Constitution**: The law "cannot permit any public authority to know the race of those entitled to be protected."  
>  – Warned that the decision would prove as pernicious as _Dred Scott_.

> **Precedents / Authorities cited?**  
>  – _Slaughter‑House Cases_ (1873) (narrow 14th Am.), _Civil Rights Cases_ (1883) (state vs. private action).

> **Constitutional provisions?**  
>  – 13th Amendment (involuntary servitude)  
>  – 14th Amendment §1 (Equal Protection & Privileges/Immunities)

> **Level of scrutiny?** – Proto‑**rational basis** (court required only minimal justification).

> **Significance?**  
>  – Legitimized Jim Crow for nearly six decades.  
>  – Overruled _de jure_ in _Brown v. Board_ (1954) but still cited as a cautionary tale of "textual literalism" + racism.  
>  – Harlan’s dissent became the intellectual seed for modern Equal Protection.

### 2. United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144 (1938)

> **Facts?**  
>  – Congress passed the **Filled Milk Act of 1923**, criminalizing interstate shipment of "Milnut"—milk mixed with coconut oil—on public‑health grounds.  
>  – Carolene Products was indicted for violating the Act and argued it lacked a rational basis, breaching the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process.

> **Carolene’s argument?**  
>  – Scientific evidence showed filled milk is no more harmful than dairy butterfat; the statute is economic protectionism for dairy interests.  
>  – Thus violates substantive due process just like the Lochner line of cases.

> **Government’s argument?**  
>  – Congress reasonably believed filled milk endangered children; the Court must defer under its **police power**.

> **Issue?**  
>  – Does economic legislation that restricts a specific food product violate substantive due process when the health justification is contested?

> **Holding?**  
>  – **No.** The Act is constitutional. Courts will defer if any **conceivable rational basis** exists.

> **Reasoning (Justice Stone):**  
>  – Judicial review of **economic regulation is narrow**. It is up to legislators, not judges, to weigh evidence.  
>  – Court abandons Lochner‑style scrutiny for economic laws.

> **Famous Footnote Four:**  
>  1. **Bill of Rights** violations may merit stricter review;  
>  2. Laws distorting **political processes** (voting, dissemination of information) may require more exacting judicial scrutiny;  
>  3. Laws targeting **"discrete and insular minorities"** need heightened vigilance.  
>  👉 Birth of tiers‑of‑scrutiny & modern Equal Protection doctrine.

> **Constitutional provision?**  
>  – Fifth Amendment **Due Process** (applies to federal statutes).

> **Level of scrutiny?** – **Rational basis** for economic regulation.

> **Significance?**  
>  – Marks the **end of Lochner** era.  
>  – Footnote Four sets the analytic framework for strict & intermediate scrutiny, laying groundwork for racial & gender jurisprudence.

### 3. Korematsu v. United States. 323 U.S. 214 (1944)

> **Facts?**  
>  – After Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt issued **EO 9066** authorizing military zones.  
>  – Civilian Exclusion Order 34 required all persons of Japanese ancestry to evacuate the West Coast.  
>  – **Fred Korematsu**, native‑born citizen, refused relocation, was arrested, convicted, and appealed.

> **Korematsu’s argument?**  
>  – The order imposes **race‑based internment** without individualized suspicion, violating equal protection (via 5th Am Due Process) and fundamental liberties.

> **Government’s argument?**  
>  – Military necessity: fear of espionage and sabotage justified swift group measures; courts must defer in wartime.

> **Issue?**  
>  – Can the federal government exclude and intern U.S. citizens based solely on race under wartime powers?

> **Holding?**  
>  – **Yes.** The exclusion order is constitutional.

> **Reasoning (Justice Black):**  
>  – Racial classifications are suspect and subject to strict scrutiny, **but** the gravest imminent danger can justify them.  
>  – Court deferred to the military’s judgment of necessity.

> **Dissents:**  
>  – **Murphy:** Called it "legalized racism", no evidence of threat.  
>  – **Jackson:** Warned the decision lies about facts; once precedent, it’s a "loaded weapon".  
>  – **Roberts:** No due process, obvious race discrimination.

> **Later treatment:**  
>  – Documents in the 1980s showed the government lied about military necessity; Korematsu’s conviction vacated (coram nobis).  
>  – **Trump v. Hawaii** (2018): Court said Korematsu was "gravely wrong," effectively disavowing it.

> **Significance?**  
>  – Stands as the **canonical warning** of deference gone wrong.  
>  – Illustrates the fragility of civil liberties in wartime.

### 4. Brown v. Board of Education (Brown I), 347 U.S. 483 (1954)

> **Facts?**  
>  – Consolidated cases from Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, D.C.  
>  – Black children forced to attend segregated schools with inferior facilities and resources.

> **Plaintiffs’ argument?**  
>  – Segregation denies equal educational opportunities, violates Equal Protection even if physical facilities are equal.  
>  – Relied on social science (Dr. Kenneth Clark’s doll tests) showing psychological harm.

> **States’ argument?**  
>  – Relied on _Plessy_: separate but equal satisfies the Constitution; education is a state matter.

> **Issue?**  
>  – Does state‑mandated public‑school segregation violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment?

> **Holding?**  
>  – **Yes.** Separate educational facilities are **inherently unequal**.

> **Reasoning (Chief Justice Warren, unanimous):**  
>  – Education is "the most important function" of state and local gov’t.  
>  – Segregation generates **sense of inferiority** that affects motivation to learn.  
>  – Historical intent of 14th Amendment inconclusive; must be read in light of present-day importance of education.

> **Implementation (Brown II – 1955):**  
>  – Desegregation "**with all deliberate speed**"—led to decade‑long resistance.

> **Significance:**  
>  – Overturned _Plessy_ in education; moral cornerstone of Civil Rights Movement.  
>  – Invoked by later cases on gender, disability, and LGBTQ rights.

### 5. Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954)

> **Facts?**  
>  – In Washington D.C., 12 Black children were denied entry to an all‑white school (John Philip Sousa JHS).  
>  – Because D.C. is federal territory, plaintiffs couldn’t invoke 14th Amendment.

> **Plaintiffs’ argument?**  
>  – Segregation by the federal government violates the **Due Process Clause** of the 5th Amendment.

> **Government’s argument?**  
>  – Congress has plenary authority over D.C.; segregation is long‑standing policy.

> **Issue?**  
>  – Does the Fifth Amendment prohibit the federal government from operating segregated schools?

> **Holding?**  
>  – **Yes.** Segregation in D.C. schools violates **due process**.

> **Reasoning (Chief Justice Warren):**  
>  – "Liberty" under the Fifth Amendment incorporates notions of equality.  
>  – Discrimination so unjustifiable as to be arbitrary violates due process.  
>  – Hence, equality principles **reverse‑incorporated** into the Fifth Amendment.

> **Level of scrutiny?** – Effectively **strict scrutiny** for racial classifications.

> **Significance:**  
>  – Created **reverse incorporation**: Equal Protection norms apply to the federal gov’t via Fifth Amendment.  
>  – Ensured desegregation of all public schools nationwide, not just in the states.
